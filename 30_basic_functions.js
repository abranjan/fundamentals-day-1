// Functions with strings

// Write a function that accepts a name and prints "Hello, name!"

// Write a function that accepts two strings and prints them together in a sentence.

/* 
Functions that return a boolean
Write a function that:
1. accepts a number
2. evaluates an expression with that number
3. returns true or false based on the expression
*/

let counter = 0;
// 1. Write a function that will add 5 to the counter value each time you invoke it.

// 2. Write a function that will divide the counter value by 3 and return the remainder.

// 3. Write a function that will print the counter value in a sentence.


// 1. Write 2 functions.  Both should accept a string as a parameter.  In the first, return the string.
// In the second, console.log the string.  What do you see in the console when you invoke each one?
// Can you use a variable to catch the return value from the first function?
